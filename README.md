The Odin Project: Rock Paper Scissors

This is my take on The Odin Project's Rock Paper Scissors (RPS) project.

This website will allow a user to play RPS in the console of your browser 5 times and keep score each time. The user can input a new value each time, it is not case sensitive and will account for extra spacing before/after the user's input.
